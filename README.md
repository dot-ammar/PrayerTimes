# PrayerTimes
PrayerTimes is a simple application that lives in a Windows Notification. It displays the upcoming Islamic prayer times for your location. 

There are various different perameters that can be changed in the `Config.json` file. By default you will find that the latitude and longitude is set to New York and the method is ISNA (Islamic Society of North America).

Simply click the `PrayerTimes.exe` file and a notification similar to this should show up. This is compatible with windows 10 and later.
